Appium Sample in Ruby
=====================

This folder includes sample Appium tests using Ruby for Android and iOS, which can be run in [Bitbar Cloud](https://cloud.bitbar.com/).


# Server Side Test Execution
Create a zip file containing the project, which will be uploaded to [Bitbar Cloud](https://cloud.bitbar.com/).

* On OSX/Linux machines you can just run the following command at the project's root directory:

    `./createAndroidZip.sh` This creates a zip package called: <b>android-test.zip</b>
    `./createiOSZip.sh` This creates a zip package called: <b>ios-test.zip</b>

* You can also manually zip the project's sources. You have to include at least the following files in the zip package. Note that these files have to be at the root of the zip file, i.e. not inside any additional directory.
    * run-tests.sh
    * Gemfile
    * setup_appium.rb
    * android_sample_spec.rb / ios_sample_spec.rb
