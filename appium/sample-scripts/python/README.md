# Appium Python Samples

Bitbar can be used to run Appium tests against real devices to test
native Android or iOS applications, hybrid (Android & iOS) or for web
testing (Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android).

You'll find here all steps you need to start running your mobile tests
against real devices in Bitbar cloud. Before continuing with running with
these scripts you should register with [Bitbar service](https://cloud.bitbar.com/).

For more detailed guides on Appium please refer to their
[documentation
online](http://appium.io/slate/en/master/?python#about-appium).

# Uploading Your App To Cloud

Uploading an app is easiest using the `upload.py` script and using
apiKey identification. The apiKey is found under "My Account" in
Bitbar cloud. For the upload to be successful the full path to the
app (apk or ipa) needs to be provided.

If no app is provided on command line, then the Bitbar Sample Android app is
uploaded.

```bash
$ python upload.py -h
usage: upload.py [-h] [-k APIKEY] [-a APP_PATH] [-u URL]

Upload a mobile app to Bitbar cloud and get a handle to it

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k APIKEY, --apikey APIKEY
                        User's apiKey to identify to cloud, or set environment
                        variable TESTDROID_APIKEY
  -a APP_PATH, --app_path APP_PATH
                        Path to app to upload or set environment variable
                        TESTDROID_APP_PATH. Current value is:
                        '../../../apps/builds/Testdroid.apk'
  -u URL, --url URL     Bitbar cloud url to upload app or set environment
                        variable TESTDROID_UPLOAD_URL. Current value is:
                        'https://appium.bitbar.com/upload'
```

The below example shows how to upload a hybrid Android demo app to Bitbar Cloud.

```bash
$ python upload.py -k xg8x...YXto -a ../../../apps/builds/Testdroid.apk
Filename to use in Bitbar capabilities in your test: 719f52c4-43c2-4c25-b91b-08884f049d3a/Testdroid.apk
```

The response message provides the application's cloud file name that
is the path to use with `testdroid_app` capability. From the above
example the path to store is:
'719f52c4-43c2-4c25-b90b-08884f049d3a/Testdroid.apk'.


# Common Settings in Example Tests

There are some common settings needed to run any of the example tests,
regardless of the app type being tested. Each `testdroid_*.py` file
needs to have the following values set as environment variables or set
in the files. Values can also be given as command line parameters to
`run-test.py` script.

Common values used in tests:

* *screenshot_dir* - where should screenshots be stored on your local drive

* *testdroid_username* - your email that you registered with to
   Bitbar cloud.  **Rather use testdroid_apiKey.**

* *testdroid_password* - your Bitbar cloud password. **Rather use
   testdroid_apiKey.**

* *testdroid_apiKey* - a personal unique key allowing you to connect
   to Bitbar cloud without using username and passwords in
   tests. Api key is found under "My account" in [Bitbar cloud](https://cloud.bitbar.com/) UI.

* *testdroid_project* - the project name in Bitbar cloud. Each
  project's name is unique. A project's name can be modified later on if needed.

* *testdroid_testrun* - name of this test run inside of
  `testdroid_project`. Each test run can have the same name, but it is
  recommended to set it dynamically (e.g. with timestamp or device
  name). If no test run name is given, the system automatically names
  it in "Test Run x".

* *testdroid_app* - name of the app uploaded using `upload.py`
  script. Example filename could be
  'f4660af0-10f4-46e9-932b-0622f497b0d2/Testdroid.apk' To rerun using
  last uploaded app testdroid_app can be set to *latest*

## Example Run

```bash
$ python run-test.py -k xYY5...PeOA6 -s /tmp/screens/ -p "iOS" -t testdroid_ios -a "latest"
testSample (testdroid_ios.TestdroidIOS) ... Searching Available Free iOS Device...

## Native iOS Example

Example script: `testdroid_ios.py`

To run iOS native app tests additional parameter is required to be provided:

* **bundleId** - this is your application's unique name

```bash
$ python run-test.py -k xYY5...PeOA6 -s /tmp/screens/ -p "iOS" -r `date +%R` -a "latest" --bundle_id "com.bitbar.testdroid.BitbarIOSSample" -t testdroid_ios  
```

This parameter is not needed if running against the sample BitbarIOSSample.ipa application, as it's set inside of the sample script.


## Native Android Example

Example script: `testdroid_android.py`

To run an Appium test against a native Android application Appium needs to the
following additional information:

* **app_package** - Java package of the Android app you want to run

* **app_activity** - activity name for the Android activity you want to
  launch from your package. Typically this is the main activity.

For running the sample applications and tests these do not need to be set as they are set inside of the sample scripts if no parameter is given.

```bash
python run-test.py -k xYY5...PeOA6 -s /tmp/screens -a 830571c8-51f1-4cd1-ad91-82e76c00a1b0/BitbarSampleApp.apk -p "Android Native" -r  `date +%R` -t testdroid_android
```

## Hybrid Android Specific Settings

Example: `testdroid_android_hybrid.py`

Additional parameters needed to run a hybrid app:

* **app_package** - Java package of the Android app you want to run

* **app_activity** - activity name for the Android activity you want to
  launch from your package. Typically this is the main activity.

The above parameters are already set into the test scripts, so they are not mandatory for the sample tests. For other apps they are.

```bash
python run-test.py -k xYY5...PeOA6 -s /tmp/screens/ -t testdroid_android_hybrid -p "Android Hybrid"  -r `date +%R` --app b9608704-b55d-4b71-83d4-d8027c67b49a/Testdroid.apk
```

## Safari Browser Testing

Does not need any specific settings.

Example: `testdroid_safari.py`

```bash
python run-test.py -k xYY5hc8PXAXsBBd1G3ijnb18wlqPeOA6 -s /tmp/screens/ -t testdroid_safari -p "Safari browser"  -r `date +%R`
```

##  Chrome Browser Testing

Does not need any special settings.

Example: `testdroid_chrome.py`

```bash
python run-test.py -k xYY5hc8PXAXsBBd1G3ijnb18wlqPeOA6 -s /tmp/screens/ -t testdroid_chrome -p "Chrome browser"  -r `date +%R`
```
